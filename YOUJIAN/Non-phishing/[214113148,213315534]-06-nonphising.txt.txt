Dear Jun,	
	I really appreciate you joining us at Vim, and I know you will love it when you see how easy it is to deliver awesome, personal support to every student.
		While I see that you have already setup your mailbox, I thought I would send a note and offer a hand with getting more out of Vim. A few of our customers run similar software to help their students out. They have given me permission to share some support strategies that have been using to get up to date. I would love to explain it to you.
Can we schedule a 5 minute Skype chat for this afternoon or tomorrow? Let me know what suits you better.
Thanks 
Chris
