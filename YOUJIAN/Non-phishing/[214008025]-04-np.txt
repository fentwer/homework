Hi Jun,
Thanks for the tips on publishing papers on network traffic classification at the IEEE meeting last week. It seems to be a bit harder now to get into the field with such detailed papers already published such as yours! I was wondering if you were interested in catching up for further to have a chat about other areas of study such as network and system security and social spam detection? There are a few others that are meeting in a pub on Bourke Road in Camberwell on Friday if you had wanted to join us – just a small group of like-minded people interested in similar fields of study.
Otherwise we will hopefully see each other at the next IEEE meeting!
Cheers,
Bru T. Phorce
