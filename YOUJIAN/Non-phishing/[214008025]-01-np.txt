Hi Jun!
Did you know that Funds4Kids raised $150.2K at our annual fundraiser this year? Thanks to your help we have been able to provide:
-	10,000 new uniforms for school kids attending primary schools who otherwise would not be able to wear clean, wearable uniforms for their education!
-	60,000 education packs for school kids that will help them learn the basic numeracy and literacy skills needed for the classroom!
-	1,000 schools across the country with funds that allow for new canteen systems that promote a healthy, hearty lifestyle for these kids!
-	4,000 stationary kits for secondary school students that will allow for them to do the necessary course work that will allow for them to go further in their studies!
Thanks to you and your donation, this year has been one of our most successful years in providing kids with the best chance in life and we hope it will just keep getting better!
From the team at Funds4Kids
