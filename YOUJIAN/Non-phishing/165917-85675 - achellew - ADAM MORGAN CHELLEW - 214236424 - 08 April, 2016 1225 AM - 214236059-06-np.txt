Jun Zang,

We are conducting a new article on Network cluster nods. And would like to know if you would be interested in joining our research team. We would love to have you back, since we produced great work last time on our works regarding, the efficient imputation method for neighbourhood-based collaborative filtering.

If you are interested in joining the team just send me an email, and I can forward all the current work and introduce you to the team.

From, W Zhou.
