Dear Jun, 


Thank you for considering us a worthy sponsor of the Winston Elementary School Fete. It is with regret that will be unable to assist this year. 

Tough economic conditions throughout the country, and particularly in our industry, has forced us to reassess our budget and policy on donations. Unfortunately, this fiscal year, our budget has been expended. 

Our company appreciates the importance of corporate giving, particularly when the beneficiary is an educational institution, and we would be honored to be considered again in the future. To help us help you, you may like to consider forwarding your sponsorship application earlier in the fiscal year so we can include you in our plans. 

We wish you a successful and happy day at the fete. 



Sincerely, 
Veronica
