Dear Jun,

Thank you for inquiring about the email software advertised on my blog. Each of the listed software functions uniquely on different platforms. Before I recommend a particular one, I would like to know a bit more about you and your needs:

1. What kind of business do you handle? Are you self-employed , manager or a business owner?
2. Will you be using the software on a mobile device or computer? Is your computer a Mac or PC?
3. What kind of emails do you send most often? Are they replies to customer questions, business-to-business information or just emails for team members?
Once again, thank you for your interest in purchasing some of the email software advertised on my site. I hope you will find them suitable for your business needs.

Cordially,
Ayo
