To Jun Zhang,

Your student Jason Miao has requested to enrol into my class “MAM324 Mathematics for Programmers”. 
Due to the nature of this class I am unable to accept just any student as the failure rate of this 
class to too high. I am currently trying to find students who are capable of attempting such a 
difficult unit. If possible, I would like to know more about this student, and whether you think 
he is capable for my class. If you can provide me information on this student that would be highly 
appreciated. 

With Thanks,
Dr. Nick Reviera
