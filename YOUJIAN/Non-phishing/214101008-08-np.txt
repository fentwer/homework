Dear Jun, 

We are writing to inform you that the book you had borrowed, “Life & Death: IT Practices” by Julie Wallnut and Andy Summers is now overdue. 

We would request that you return this to the library as soon as possible, as charges of $1.50 will accumulate each day, and after a month you would need to pay the full price of the textbook, as well as a 10% interest rate. 

Kind regards, Deakin University Library
