Dr. Jun Zhang

My name is Dr. Greg Humphrey, and I am currently working to put together a paper including many different articles in the field of Corporate IT security.
I have read your work in the past, and think that you could make a great addition to this paper. Your work on watermarking schemes was excellent, and I feel
some similar work could really help this project, as well as to help get you yourself some further exposure.

Please reply to this email to let me know if you are interested, and I shall give you further details then.

Regards,

Dr. Greg Humphrey
