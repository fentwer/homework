Hi Jun,

Me and my partner are having their wedding on the 16th of April. We are going to be sending out official invitations soon, but reaching out to you because
I want you to be my best man. I come back from Japan at the end of March so we can discuss things more in person. Judy can't wait to meet you and your family!
I'll be in touch soon.

Your favourite brother,

Kai
