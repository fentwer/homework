Hi Dr. Zhang,

My name is Sebastian Todd, and I've just read your paper on watermarking schemes. I was just a little bit confused about how these watermarks could be utilised on a large scale? 
Also what sort of multimedia are watermarks used on? I noticed JPEG images are one example, would they also be included in things such as DVD realeases? 
If you could just explain that to me simply I'd really appreciate it, it would help me a lot with my studies.

Thanks,

Sebastian Todd
