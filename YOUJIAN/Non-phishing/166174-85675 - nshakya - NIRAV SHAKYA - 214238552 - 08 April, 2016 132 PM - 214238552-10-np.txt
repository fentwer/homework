Hi Prof Zhang,

I wanted to work as a research assistant for IT Security and wanted to know if you had any idea as to how I could begin to apply for these roles. 

I have heard that unihub is a good place to look for it but also wanted to know if there is something I could do to be prepared and what exactly is expected of us in this role.

Thank you

Regards
