Hi Jun,

I hope you're doing well. I greatly enjoyed working with you on the network traffic research paper. I'm interested in collaborating with you again, and I have some ideas I would like to share with you. Please let me know when you're free for a coffee to catch up and discuss this further.

Cheers,
Yang Xiang.
