Hi Jun,

My name is Trevor Allen and I'm a student in your Corporate Computer and Network Security class. I'm having a little bit of trouble with the sixth part in the first assignment, the part
about a technical demonstration of the attack with the screenshots present. How are we supposed to get the screenshots without conducting an actual attack? Are we just supposed to do 
the attack on a virtual machine as we do in the pracs?

Also, while going through your papers for the assignment, I struggled to quite understand what watermarking schemes are. It was quite confusing to understand, could you possibly explain it
in some simple detail to help me out?

Thanks,

Trevor Allen
