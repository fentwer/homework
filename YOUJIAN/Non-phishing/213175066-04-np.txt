Dear Deakin students and staff


We have all been shocked and saddened by the recent tragic events that have taken place around the world. Over the past few days, the University has reached out to students from France and Lebanon to offer support but I am sure that there are other members of our large Deakin family, both within and outside Australia who have also been impacted. 
Many of you are aware that we provide a range of services for students and staff that have been established to provide many different types of support. If you feel you need help or support, then please use our services which are described in the link below.

I do encourage you to look after yourselves and to support each other, most particularly as we approach the summer break. If in doubt, get in touch.

Best wishes,

Jane
