Hi Everyone,
I thought I would just bulk email the Uni group to let you know I will back in New South Whales for a week or two before I fly out to Sydney if anyone is around and wants to catch up.
It has been too long since I saw everyone last (probably when we were in Uni).
I was think we could all go see a new movie and grab dinner in somewhere fancy afterwards or something like that.
If anyone is interested in joining me next Friday, just shoot me back an email or text or call me or something.

Cheers,
David Eggroll :)
