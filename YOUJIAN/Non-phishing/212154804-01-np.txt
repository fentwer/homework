Hi Jun,
Thanks for submitting the Network Traffic Classification paper to the IEEE.
I would like to know if we are still meeting even though the paper has been published.
If we do meet, are we still planning to further research and go into more detail about Traffic Classification using Correlation?
Finally, if we are continuing to meet, could I please grab some details from you about which room we plan to meet in next as well as the date and time.

Thanks in advance,
Yang Xiang
