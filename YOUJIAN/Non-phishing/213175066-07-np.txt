Subject: MALWARE on Scam-email

Message: 

Dear Colleagues,
Deakin eSolutions have been advised that there is yet another scam email in circulation, this time pretending to offer a free upgrade to Windows 10. 
The email has a zip file attached which when opened will install ransomware on your computer 
This is the malware which encrypts every file on your PC plus any Deakin network shares and asks for a ransom to decrypt your files.
If you receive this sort of email please just delete it.
Microsoft never distributes patches or upgrades via email!
The eSolutions Service Desk (03 5227 2400) can assist if required.


Kind Regards,
William Confalonieri
Chief Digital Officer
Deakin University
