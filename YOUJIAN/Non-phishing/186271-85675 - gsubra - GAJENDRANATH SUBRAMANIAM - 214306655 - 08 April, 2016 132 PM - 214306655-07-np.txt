Dear Gajendranath

You’ll be able to view your timetable from 9 am Tuesday 16 February. You can change your allocations if your timetable doesn’t suit or if there are activities you haven’t been allocated to yet. If you are happy with your timetable you don’t need to do anything.

STAR will close down one final time at 9 am Monday 21 March 2016 and will reopen at 5 pm on the same day in a read only mode.

 

For further information visit the STAR website.

 

All the best of luck with your studies this Trimester.

 

Yours sincerely

Deakin STAR Team
