Dear Jun Zhang, 

It's Heather Lane your travel agent. I have just recieved an email from QANTAS letting me know that your flight tomorrow to San Francisco has been
cancelled due to some severe weather that is due to hit in 12 hours time. 

At this stage your flight has been rescheduled for 12.45pm in four days time as the weather should have passed by then and flights into San 
Francisco will have started again. I will make sure to change your hotel bookings as well and will send you an updated itinerary when I have done so. 

Let me know if you are still happy to fly back the same day or would prefer me to move it four days forward so you will stay for the same amount of
time as was originally planned.

Kind Regards,
Heather Lane
