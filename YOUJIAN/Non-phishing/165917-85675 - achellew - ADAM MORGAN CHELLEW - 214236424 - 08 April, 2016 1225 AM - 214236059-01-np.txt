Hello Jun

We are just a little worried that you have not replied to our previous email regarding the new “Malware accuracy approach”. As this is important for everyone here at Deakin University we need your findings and information on the subject ASAP.

For any queries regarding the testing please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely, Vice-Chancellor Jane den Hollander
