Dear Jun,
	My name is Frank. I am a research student in Deakin University. Currently I am doing research on watermarking techniques. During my research work I came across some of your work on watermarking. 
	While working on the project I was stuck with some questions. Fortunately I came across some of your work on the topic, which solved my queries. I just wanted to thank you for the indirect help you did for my project work.
Sincerely,
Frank
