Hi Jun,

I've been recommended to you from one of your friends. My son is interested into IT but isn't sure what field he wants to major in. He enjoys playing
video games but I don't think he wants to make them. I think he is more into something called cloud but I don't know what he's talking about. He also
told me that he would like to teach in the future. If you could lead us into the right path that would be great.

Regards,

John
