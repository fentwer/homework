Dear Jun,
		This is Vincent from your SIT384 class. I’m sorry for missing class last Wednesday, I had a family emergency that I needed to attend to. I’m hoping that you might be able to give me notes for the material that I missed.
		I will really appreciate your help in this matter.
Sincerely,
Vincent 
SIT384
