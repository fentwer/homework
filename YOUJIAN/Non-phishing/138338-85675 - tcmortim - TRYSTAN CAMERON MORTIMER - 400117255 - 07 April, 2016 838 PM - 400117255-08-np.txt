Dear Jun,

On behalf of everyone at Telstra, please accept my sincere apologies for the recent disruption to the Telstra mobile network. We are deeply disappointed that this problem occurred and are working hard to prevent this happening again. 
  
To help make up for any inconvenience, we hope you can take advantage of our free data day within Australia this Sunday 3 April 2016. Whether youâ€™re on a pre-paid or post-paid mobile, tablet or mobile broadband plan, you will automatically receive free data, from midnight to midnight in your local Australian time zone, on Sunday 3 April 2016.
  
We remain committed to providing you the best mobile network in Australia and meeting your expectations every day. 


Michael Simpson

Executive Director, Mobiles
