Good morning Jun,

Hope you are well.
As you know we have a scheduled faculty meeting at 4:30pm tomorrow.

Unfortunately, my plane was delayed in Singapore and I will arrive in Melbourne around 3:30pm tomorrow afternoon. Is it possible for you to grab the papers on my desk labelled ‘Meeting’ as I don’t think I will have time to retrieve them?

Regards,
Lei Pan
