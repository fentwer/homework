Dear Deakin students and staff,

Deakin Facilities Services Division wishes to advise that power to the east side of the Burwood Campus will be disrupted on Saturday 9 April 5:30 am- 6:00 am.
This shutdown is required so that essential Building M and Atrium project works can be carried out. 

Entry to affected buildings will not be permitted during the 30 minute shutdown (unless approved prior) for safety reasons.   
The affected buildings will be:
Buildings                                              O and K
Buildings                                              HI, HJ and HK

Please ensure your work is saved and your computer is turned off prior to the shutdown to avoid loss of data.

We will endeavour to minimise any inconvenience. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me.

King regards,
Todd Leake
