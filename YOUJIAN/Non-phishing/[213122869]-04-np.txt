Hi Jun, 

The kids have school holidays next week and I was going to take them to Melbourne Zoo on Thursday however I have been called in to work. 
I had already told them about it and they were so excited so when I told them that I had to go into work and I would have to make other
arrangements for them for the day they were very disappointed. 

I'm pretty sure it is uni holidays then as well and was hoping they're favourite uncle would be available to take them to the zoo?
I know they would love you to and they haven't seen you in ages!

Love your favourite Sister-in-Law,
Sally
