We write to advise that we will be carrying out a Routine Inspection at your property on 7 April 2016 between 09:00 AM and 12:00 PM. 
You are welcome to be in attendance, however, should you not be able to make this inspection, we will use our office set of keys to obtain entry. Please be aware that as multiple inspections are carried out within the above time frame, we will be unable to change the date or time of your inspection.
 Enclosed is a Maintenance Request Form and we request that any repair or maintenance requirements you may be aware of are outlined so we may include in our report to your Landlord. We ask that you leave this completed form on the kitchen bench for us to collect. We look forward to seeing you should you be in attendance.

 Yours faithfully, 
McInnes Property Management
