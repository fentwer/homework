Dear colleagues
 
Last week the Policy Office advised that the Conflict of Interest Procedure had a number of amendments made to it including:
clarifying what constitutes a conflict of interest (COI) and the context in which a conflict may arise;
providing greater clarity for staff and their supervisors in relation to the process for declaring a COI and development of a new COI Form for their use;
providing greater clarity in relation to the areas within the University that are responsible for managing and providing advice in relation to COI; and
implementing a clearer system for collating and recording declared COI.
 
The University's Code of Conduct requires staff to avoid COI and where COI do arise, to manage those conflicts appropriately in accordance with the Conflict of Interest Procedure. Staff must ensure that they:
·         do not deliberately or inadvertently create or facilitate an actual, potential or perceived COI between their financial, professional or personal interests and the interests of the University;
·         attempt to avoid any situation that affects, or could affect, their independent, unbiased judgement in the discharge of their duties to the University;
·         excuse themselves from making any decision relating to University business when they are aware of circumstances that might reasonably cause their impartiality to be questioned;
·         advise their supervisor of any concerns they have in relation to an actual, potential or perceived COI that they have knowledge of that relates to another staff member or an associate; and
·         seek advice from their supervisor about whether to declare an actual, potential or perceived COI, in circumstances where they are unclear, uncertain or there is doubt about whether a declaration is required.
 
I encourage all staff and supervisors to review the updated procedure and consider if any action is necessary.
 
If you have any questions or concerns in relation to conflicts of interest please contact Fiona Davies, Manager, Workplace Relations, HRD (fiona.davies@deakin.edu.au).
