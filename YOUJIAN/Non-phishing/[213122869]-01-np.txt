Dear Jun Zhang,

My name is Jessica Hoy and I am currently looking at studying abroad in England for two semesters. I would like to try and match some units
from Deakin to units at my exchange university so I can receive the credit points. 

One unit I am currently looking at matching is SIT384 Corportate Computer and Network Security. I would like to either email you the 
unit outline of the unit that I think corresponds at the exchange university or come by your office and drop it off or discuss it with you?

I am happy to do either, please let me know which one you prefer.


Thank you,

Jessica Hoy
