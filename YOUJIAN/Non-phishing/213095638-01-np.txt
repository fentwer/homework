Hello Jun,

Hope you are well. I am very happy with the Security article we published with Ivan Stojmenovic and Peter Mueller earlier this year. I was particularly interested in the piece regarding reliability in this area and want to pursue further exploration in this topic. 
I am in current communications with both Ivan and Peter and they seem willing to join me. 
Would you be interested in further study of this topic?

Look forward to hearing back from you.

Regards, 
Yang Xiang
