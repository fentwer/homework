Dear Jun Zhang,

We have recently moved on from CloudDeakin onto Deakin Sync. Deakin Sync is a newly improved user interface, with the intention of keeping all staff and students connected and in control, so you can always access what's important to you.

This change will commence starting on the 28th of February, and by April 1st all users will be switched over to Sync.

Thank you for your time. 

Regards,
Deakin University IT Help Desk
