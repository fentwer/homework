Dear Jun,
I am currently having trouble with getting R to display the output of my frequency analysis on assignment 1 for SIT384.

I have managed to do the frequency analysis of your published papers, but am unable to plot them on a graph.
The error i am getting is 'x' must be an array of at least two dimensions.

Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
