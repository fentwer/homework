Dear Jun,
	My name is George. Currently enrolled in SIT384 for the current semester. I am writing this mail regarding the new structure of the unit from this trimester. I found it really hard to understand few of the topics during classes and practical. On top of that assignment 1 was very confusing. It was very hard to understand and relate the topics.	
	Can you please look into this matter and address my concern. Looking forward to hear from you soon.
Thank you,
George
