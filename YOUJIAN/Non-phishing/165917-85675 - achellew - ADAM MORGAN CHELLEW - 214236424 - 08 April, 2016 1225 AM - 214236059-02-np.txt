Dr. Jun Zang

This is just a follow up email regarding our paper on Zero-day node cluster prevention we are getting worried that you might have forgotten to do your part as we have not heard from you yet. If you are having trouble, then we may need to collaborate in person so let’s organize a meet to talk about our paper.

Kind regards, L Ye.
