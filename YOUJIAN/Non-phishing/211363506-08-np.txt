Hi Dr. Jun Zhang,

I am a student enrolled in SIT384. I have been allocated in the practical session for Wednesday afternoons at 4pm. Unfortunately, I wonâ€™t be able to make that session as I have work. Is it possible to have my session changed so I am able to study this unit? 

Thanks,
Kevin Wilson
