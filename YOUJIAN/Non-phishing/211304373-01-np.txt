Dear Jun Zhang,

We have just received new stock on our current line of watches. Originally selling just one style (silver with black face), 
we now have a wide variety of straps and faces you can now select. The best part of this is that now you can mix and match 
and create your very own unique design of watches. Whether it’s for the professional look for when you are at work, or the 
casual watch to match the everyday lifestyle, you can now have a watch for any occasion. 

The straps can come in multiple colours such as: red, black, white, blue, green, purple, orange, and silver.

Also, you can choose the material the strap is made from such as metal, leather, or rubber. 

Now, we have different options of faces to choose from. You can now choose from either a digital face with backlighting 
with the press of a button, or even an analogue face. Although we only have the one style of the digital face, the 
analogue face can come with different coloured dials. When you are ready, pop into our brand new shop front at 
34 Juan Way, Abbotsfield 3999. If it is too far out of your way, not to worry, we also have an ebay store you can view 
under the name “watchsthetime”. 

It’s a pleasure doing business with you,

Watch’s the time!
