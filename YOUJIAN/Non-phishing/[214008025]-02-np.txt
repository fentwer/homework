Good afternoon Dr Zhang,
I was wondering if you were able to direct me to the best possible point of contact within the school to enquire about a position in tutoring in the field of Network Security.
I am a PhD student at Deakin University studying Networks and IT Security and I am looking for experience and to be able to share my knowledge with others that are passionate about security and have a willingness to learn. In university and in my own time I have developed a passion for the R machine learning language even though many people find it difficult and sometimes not directly related to the coursework. Other skills that I have are learnt and are passionate in include being able to create phishing messages from data extracted from R, making ggplots work in the R-portable program and also creating non-phishing messages to make contact with people.

If you are able to assist me with my enquiry about a position in tutoring at Deakin University, I would very much appreciate your help.
I look forward to your reply.
Regards,
Ann Nonormos
