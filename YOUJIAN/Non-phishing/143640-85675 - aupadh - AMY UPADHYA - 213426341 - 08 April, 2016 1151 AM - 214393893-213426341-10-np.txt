Dear Dr Zhang,

DISC is organising an IT Security day to encourage more students to get involved in the cyber security field. We would greatly appreciate it if you would give a talk on network traffic. We're hoping to have the event on Thursday 28 April 2016 from 11:00am-4:00pm in the Burwood campus. Kindly let us  know if you are interested.

Best Regards,
The DISC Team.
