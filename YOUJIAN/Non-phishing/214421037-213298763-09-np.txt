Dear IT team, 

I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their friendship over the years. My career at Deakin has been truly memorable and the years have just flown by. As most of you are probably aware now, I am to retire at the end of the month, when I intend to return to my hometown.  

I understand that Robert has been considering his options seriously about who should replace me, and I know that whoever he picks will be up to the task. Those in the running have much experience and knowledge, and it will be a difficult choice for Robert to make. 

Departing the Deakin and this town will not be easy, and it is everyone here who makes the move even more difficult. Remember though that my lawn, is always there for those who want to join us in York for a barbecue and picnic. 



Sincerely,
Ben
