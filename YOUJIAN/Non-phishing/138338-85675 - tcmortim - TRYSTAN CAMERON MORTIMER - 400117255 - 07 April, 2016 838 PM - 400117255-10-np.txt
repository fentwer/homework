Dear Jun, 

Have you ever dropped your phone? Remember that heart-beat skipping moment where you don’t know if your phone is intact or unrepairable? Right now, many governments are considering laws that could break your security the way dropping a phone could break your screen. How? Legislation that undermines strong encryption threatens the security of tools we use everyday like iMessage, online banking, and online shopping.

Unlike cracks on your screen, dangers to encryption aren't always easily seen. But together we can make these threats visible. By spreading the word about the importance of strong encryption we can help our friends and our lawmakers understand how such regulation can impact our lives. Staying informed is the key to fighting back against these kinds of laws and to stopping them from being written in the future.

Check out our latest video that highlights some of the biggest threats to encryption — will you watch the video and sign up to become an encryption champion? 

What would you do if there was a crack in your phone?
We stand for the open Web. We believe that our digital security is non-negotiable and that governments shouldn’t undermine the technologies that protect our security online. By signing up to be an encryption champion we’re taking a pledge to put these values into practice.

You’re not in this alone. Mozilla is here to help — but we also need you! If you let us know which country you’re in, we can send you the most relevant news and updates. We’ll also give you tips about how you can use encryption more effectively in your own life. Together, we can keep the Web open, stronger, and more secure. 

Are you in? 

Sara, on behalf of the Mozilla team 

P.S. — Over the last few weeks we’ve learned about encryption and the ways we use it everyday. Now it’s time for us to come together to stand for strong encryption and the open Web. Will you sign up to become an encryption champion?
