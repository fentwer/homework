Good afternoon Dr. Jun Zhang,

I am researching Internet traffic classification using constrained clustering and I was wondering if you had a hard copy of the journal ‘Parallel and Distributed Systems’ by Yu Wang, Yang Xiang, Jun Zhang, Wanlei Zhou, Guiyi Wei, Laurence T Yang?

Thanks,
Justin Carey
