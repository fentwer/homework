Dear All

 

Over the weekend we heard the devastating news that Nepal had experienced the worst earthquake in 80 years.

 

We understand this may be a difficult time for some of you and that you may have friends and relatives in the affected areas.  We want to remind you that you are not alone, there are staff at Deakin to provide support to you personally and with your studies.

 

International Student Advisers are located on each campus, and they are available to meet with you to provide individual support.  Please refer to this link for their contact details http://www.deakin.edu.au/students/international/isas-are-here-to-help

 

Deakin also has counselling and medical staff who are available to support you along with Chaplaincy staff.   Please contact Student Life reception to make an appointment with one of the above services http://www.deakin.edu.au/life-at-deakin/health-wellbeing-safety/medical-centres/campus-information

 

Please note if you are unable to access these services on campus, you can link in with the above services by phone.  Students affected by the Nepalese earthquake will be given priority to access the counselling and medical services and will be connected with staff promptly.

 

Our thoughts are with you and your families at this time.

 

Kind regards

 

Linda Jackson
