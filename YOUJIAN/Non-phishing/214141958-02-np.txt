Hi, Jun!
This is Jim Zhou. Long time no see. How’s your going? I just move to a new house. When you are free, I would like to invite you to my new home to have lunch or dinner. Don’t forget to bring your family as well. I will also call up our few old friends to come as well. I will wait for your reply.
All the best to you!
Jim
