Hi Jun,

I'm a friend of your brothers, and he's told me to get in touch with you. We are going to PAX again this year and have an extra space since my partner
can't go. Would you be interested? He's mentioned you play StarCraft 2. We are looking to get signed autographs at 11am from the pros. Let me know
if that fits your schedule. It's the first week of October.

Regards,

Jimmy
