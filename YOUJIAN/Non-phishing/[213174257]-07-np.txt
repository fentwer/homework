Hi Dr Jun Zhang

I'm currently a student at Deakin University who is current undertaking a Bachelor of Networking and Security and have been researching various aspects of networks and their environments and came across your publication page called 'Traffic identification in semi-known network environment'.

I am unfortunately however unable to access this particular research paper that is available on the IEEE Explore Digital Library and therefore unable to view the contents as Deakin University is not incorporated into their institiutional sign in.

Would it be possible for you to send a copy of the following publication paper 'Traffic identification in semi-known network environment'?, as I believe it will assist in my studies and enhance my existing knowledge of networks.

Regards
