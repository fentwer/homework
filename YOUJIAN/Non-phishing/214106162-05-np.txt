Hi Dr. Jun Zhang,

My name is Mark Smith and I too am a researcher in the Field of IT and I
have recently come across you research papers which I find to be of 
exceptional quality. I have started writting my own research paper on IT 
security affecting the stock market and was wondering to get your 
professional opinion on this document and its contents.

My research document can be found at:
https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=KChZ8PkAAJ&citation_for_view=KChZ8PkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C
Any feedback will be very appreciated

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Mark Smith
