Hi Jun,

The annual Christmas party with all our friends at Thomas St park is going to happen again this year! 
We were thinking 2pm and there is BBQ at the park please bring your own meat for you and your family.

Sarah said she is going to make a Greek Salad, if you could bring your famous Colesaw that would be great!

Just shoot me an email back to let me know you guys are all coming.

Look forward to seeing you all there!
Lucy
