Dear Dr. Jun Zhang

My name is Mark Richards, I am a student doing honors in IT security, and am writing a paper on watermarking schemes for submission. I have found several articles of yours on the subject, and would like some
of your adcvice about how to proceed writing my paper. I would love to send you some of my notes on the subject, and perhaps come in and talk to you at some point about certain topics
that I am struggling a bit with. Please let me know if you would be avalaible to help me out in some way.

Thanks,

Mark Richards
