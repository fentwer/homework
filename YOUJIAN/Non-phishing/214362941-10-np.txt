Dear User,


We emailed you a short while ago to help us resolve an issue with your
PayPal account. Your account was temporarily limited as a security measure
and full access has not been restored yet because we haven't heard from you.

We understand it may be frustrating not to have full access to your PayPal
account and need to work with you to resolve the issue and restore full
access to your account as quickly as possible.

What's the issue?

We noticed some information is missing or incomplete on your PayPal account
and requested your help. Because we haven't heard from you, we've limited
your account. This means you can't withdraw, send, receive or request
money. The limitation will be lifted once the issue is resolved.

Reference Number: PP-000-000-000-000

How you can help

It's usually pretty easy to take care of things like this. Most of the
time, we just need a little more information about your account or latest
transactions.

Please log in to your account and go to the Resolution Centre to find out
what you need to do. You'll also learn what you can and can't do with your
account until the issue is resolved.

Sincerely,
PayPal
