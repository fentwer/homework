Hi Gajendranath,

I wanted to remind you that the BriForum advanced discount will be ending tomorrow evening.  Save £50 if you register before midnight tomorrow and make sure to use the discount code ADVANCENA.  After tomorrow night we will be charging full price admission until the conference floors- so don’t delay!

When: 19-20 May
Where: etc venues St. Paul's, 200 Aldersgate St., London EC1A, United Kingdom
Why: Because BriForum is the only desktop and application delivery conference that is 100% vendor neutral.  The agenda is crowd sourced and curated by the team at BrianMadden.com.  You can view the full agenda here.

Cost: £800- but only for one more day!  Register now with discount code ADVANCENA. 

If you need any assistance, or have any questions regarding discounted group rates, please contact Jeremy Caci at (617) 431-9701 or email at jcaci@techtarget.com.
