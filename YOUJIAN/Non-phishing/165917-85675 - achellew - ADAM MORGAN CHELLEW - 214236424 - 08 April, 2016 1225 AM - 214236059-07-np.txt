Hello Jun,

Long-time no see, I have been informed by our old research team that they are putting together a new report on IEEE Malware network detection. I was wondering if you were going to partake on this team as I don’t think I will have the time to participate completely. So I was wondering if I could give you some of my work that I have done on this subject so I may be of some use during your report.

If you are ok with me sending you my data to pass on and share just shoot me an email, and I can put it all through to you.

Otherwise best wishes and good luck with your results.
