Dear Dr. Zhang, 

I am writing to invite you to give a technical demonstration of the construction of secure local networks for the School of IT. We are holding a seminar for under-graduate students and wish to include a showcase on networking opportunities at Deakin in the areas of post-graduate learning. 

If you could please reply to this email I will forward you the details and schedule.  

Regards,
