Greetings Jun,

Hope you are well since we last spoke.
It has been quite a while since we last work together directly, however I am hoping I could ask you for some of your expertise.

As you now I am quite experienced in malware classification. However, I am currently in the process of writing an article for the IEEE on malware patterns and statistics and need some advice.

My issue is my lack of knowledge regarding the recognition of malware-based signatures in the machine learning process. 

Would it be possible to arrange a meeting in the following weeks to discuss this topic?

Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Silvio Cesare
