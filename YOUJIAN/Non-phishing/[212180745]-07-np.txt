Hi Jun,

Good to see you the other week. I'd like to go over some of the unit material as I've had students ask me a lot of questions in the lectures.
I'll be busy over the next few days, but it would be good to sort this out before any major assignments as I can see some students struggling with some
concepts. Let me know what's a good time for you.

Regards,

Lei Pan
