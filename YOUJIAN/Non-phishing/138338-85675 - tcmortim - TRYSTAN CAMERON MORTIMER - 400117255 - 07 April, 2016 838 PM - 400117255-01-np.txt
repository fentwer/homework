Dear Jun,

What's new in Dropbox?
Work on Dropbox files together with Office Online

Working with others on the same files? If they're Microsoft Office files saved in Dropbox, now everyone can edit the same files at the same time—right from a web browser—thanks to new co-authoring support for Office Online.

Get new features to make teamwork easier

Create a free team in Dropbox to make working together simple. You’ll unlock new work features to help organize company information, centralize work projects, and keep your team up to date.
Turn feedback into conversations

With comments, you can provide feedback on a file, right from your browser. Now feedback can become a conversation, with the ability to reply directly to individual comments.

We hope you enjoy these new features!
