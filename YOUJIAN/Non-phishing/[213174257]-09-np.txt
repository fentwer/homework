Hi Jun

I was wondering if it was possible to have a meeting with you sometime today to discuss elements of an assignment that I am currently completing.
The questions I wanted to ask were in relation to the following question:
- List and provide as many descriptions on the vulnerabilities that an attacker may exploited in order to penetrate attacks within a secure network system to retrieve corporate information.
Does this question ask for us to explain the methods that an attacker may have used in order to carry out the attacks on the system from an external point.
or
The possible methods that an attacker may have performed whilst already within the network, and the key details behind the possible vulnerabilities?

Regards
