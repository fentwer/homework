Hi Jun Zhang,
It's been more than a year since you last updated your personal information.
Keeping your personal information up-to-date can help protect your account better.
Sounds like a good idea? All you have to do is go to eBay and take a look at your personal information to confirm that it's still correct. 
If you updated your personal info recently, please ignore this reminder.

Sincerely,
The eBay Accounts Team
