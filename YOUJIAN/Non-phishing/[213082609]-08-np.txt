Dear Dr. Jun Zhang

I am Dr. Jeff Scott. I have read your work on watermark schemes, and have written such a paper myself recently.
Knowing your expertise and knowledge in the area, I would greatly appreciate it if you were able to read over my paper,
and offer any insight that you can in to what I have written already. Please let me know if it would interest you to read
this paper.

Thanks,

Dr. Jeff Scott
