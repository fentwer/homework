Dear Jun,

Thanks for your much appreciated and well-thought out reply to my question the other day in regards to your publication, "Network Traffic Classification Using Correlation Information”.
Its always nice to receive feedback from a former research fellow. Please keep in touch with me, as I'd appreciate it greatly if I could learn more from you.

Kind Regards,
