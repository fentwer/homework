Subject line: Issue with the computer labs

Sorry to bother you.

There has been some issues with some of the computer labs a lot of computers are shutting down and we have disconnected them for the network. It looks like it might be a software issue but we are not sure yet. I doubt its a virus. 

Thank you for your time.
