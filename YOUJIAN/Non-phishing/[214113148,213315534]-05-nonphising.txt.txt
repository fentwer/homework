Good afternoon,
 
The Campus Transport Team have successfully rolled out Deakin’s new parking permit system.   Almost 5,000 long term Permits have been purchased and more than students 10,000 and staff have registered to use CarPark for their short term parking requirements.
 
Please take a moment to read this important update.
 
Check that you have the correct vehicle active on your permit
*         To avoid receiving an infringement, please check to ensure you have the correct vehicle active on your permit. 
*         You can list up to five vehicles CarPark), but only one can be active at a time.  
 
Driving different vehicles to campus
*         Each time you drive a different vehicle to campus, you must make that vehicle active on your permit.
