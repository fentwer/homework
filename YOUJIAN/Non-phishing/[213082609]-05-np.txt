Hi Jun,

I'm Bob Hunter, and soon I'll be transferring from Sydney to Deakin University in Waurn Ponds. I'll be joining your class on Corporate and Netowork Security, and am just
wondering if there's anything I should know beforehand? I have read your work on watermarking schemes in preparation for the class already, I found it to be quite an
interesting subject and have made some notes on it already. Hopefully that will be part of it haha :P.

Thanks, 
Bob Hunter
