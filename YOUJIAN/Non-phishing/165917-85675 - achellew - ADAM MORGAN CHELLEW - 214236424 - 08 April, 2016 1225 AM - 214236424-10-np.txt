Hello again, Jun. I have decided that it would be a better idea to meet in person regarding the previous email. I feel as though there is too much information to be discusses via email and that sitting down over it is a better way of doing things. Please let me know the times that you are availble to meet and i will get back to you.
Regards, Chunyan Chen.
