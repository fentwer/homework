Hi, my name is Stephanie Gregson. I am running a class up in Ballarat and we are currently covering Watermarking Schemes, and 
I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a bit out of my depth. In my research, I've found a paper written by you, and imagine my pleasure 
when I discovered you teach just down in Geelong! I know this may be a lot to ask, but I was wondering if at all possible you would
be able to come up and deliver a guest lecture? It would mean a lot to me and my students. If you are at all interested, just send
me a reply and we can sort out the details then.

Thanks a lot!
Stephanie Gregson
