Subject: FAKE EMAIL ASKING FOR USER AND PASSWORD

Message:

Dear Colleagues,

A fake email pretending to be the DEAKIN HELP DESK that asks recipients to click on a
link to fill out their mailbox information has been sent to a number of Deakin students and staff today.
If you receive this email, delete it immediately. Do not respond or click on any links in the email.
The email states that we are currently upgrading all mailboxes to Microsoft Office 2016, and asks users to click on a link to fill out your mailbox information.
This email is a scam and is trying to steal your username and password. 

Kind Regards
William Confalonieri
Chief Digital Officer
Deakin University
