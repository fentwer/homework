Dear Dr Zhang,
This is James cox. I’m currently in your security 384 class, but I’ve taken additional classes of yours in the past, all of which have been very informative. Recently, I have decided to switch my major to security, and I was hoping you might be willing to become my advisor.
 I realize that you must already have plenty of other students you are in charge of, but since your classes are part of the reason I decided to switch majors, I thought I would ask you first.
Please let me know at your earliest convenience if you would be willing to become my advisor.
Thank you very much,
James cox
