Hi User,
It has come to our attention that a social network work has become embedded on your machine, no need to say anything about Facebook at work!
Just for your information, social network worms leverage social platforms to send worm emails or messages containing malicious links.
We need to rectify this immediately, could you please make a ticket on our service desk: helpme@itsolutions.com.au including you user and password so we can remotely login from Ballarat and contain this before it gets to the whole network. 
It is best that we act fast, will call in the morning if no reply!
Regards,
ITSD
