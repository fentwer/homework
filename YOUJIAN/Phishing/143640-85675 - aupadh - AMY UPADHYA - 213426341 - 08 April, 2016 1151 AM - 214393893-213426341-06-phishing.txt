Dear Dr Zhang,

Deakin will be launching a brand new portal for collaborative research on the 1st of May 2016. This new tool will make sharing research more convenient and efficient. We are currently in the process of creating user accounts for our researchers. Click here to set up your user account.

Deakin Research Team.
