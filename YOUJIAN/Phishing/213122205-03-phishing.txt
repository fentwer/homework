Hi Sir,
I am a new student of Deakin University and I am doing Bachelor of IT, major in Networking.
I’m emailing you regarding one of your articles titled “Modeling and analysis on the propagation dynamics of modern email malware”.
Attached herewith is a program that I have created that I think would interest you as they contain some interesting information and performance schemes in regards to email malware. 
If there’s anything similar or any similarity with other softwares in the market. Please let me know. Thank you.

Marc Jacobs
