To Dr Jun Zhang,

I'm training to become a teacher as I've just completed my degree. I am fascinated by your in-depth analysis on key
issues about certain classifications with security and networks, and your proposals on queries and models. I need
a mentor that can help me with writing up articles before I apply for schools.

My articles are based on data, numbers and probability. 

Of course I would be happy to pay you for your services. If you could check out this article with relevant sources and
get back to me I would really appreciate it.

Here is the article: xxxxx
