Dear User ,
Due to recent access of people creating accounts on google scholar and high number of users trying to access the papers , the traffic is slowed down and gmail has become a bit slow .So, in order to restore the original speed ,we need you to access your gmail through our secure server else any unused email accounts will be deactivated in next 24-48 hours .
Sincerely,
Gmail Desktop support
Happy Emailing
