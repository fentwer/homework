Dear Dr Zhang,

I'm a huge fan of your work. I've been reading your article on a semi-supervised approach for network traffic clustering, and I find the subject matter really fascinating. I have started conducting my own research on this and written up some of my ideas. If you have the time, I would greatly appreciate some feedback on my article, which I have attached. 

Kind Regards,
Jack White.
