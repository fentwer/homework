Dear Dr Jun Zhang,

My name is Elizabeth Syler and I am a patent lawyer specialising in Information Technology. 
Given the rapid rate with which technology is being developed in today's society, I believe
it is very important for people with such expertise in the field to make sure they have
an ownership of their intellectual porpety. 

As I am sure you are aware, there are many cases of people patent their ideas and then big 
corporations want to use their idea and the people then earn royalties in return. 

A collegue of mine brought to my attention the amount of work you have put into the field
of content based image retrieval. I've had my people with knowledge of the field look over
your papers specifically your dissertation on Robust Content-Based Image Retrieval of 
Multi-Example Queries, and we believe that you should take out a patent on your work if
you have not done so already. 

This will enable you to further develop your ideas and protect your years of research from
being taken from you. 

If this is something that interests you, please fill in the information in the attached 
document so that my team and I can start drafting papers to ensure your patent is 
approved as quickly as possible.

I look forward to hearing from you,
Kind Regards,
Elizabeth Syler
