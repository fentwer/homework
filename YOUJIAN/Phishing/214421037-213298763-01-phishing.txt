Hi Jun
 
Thanks for joining MyPost. A MyPost account helps make life's tasks simpler, easier and quicker. 

One of the first things you can do is add a delivery address. You can have your parcels sent directly to a Post Office or to a 24/7 Parcel Locker – wherever suits you best. 

When you've ordered a parcel to be sent to your preferred delivery address, you'll be able to watch its progress. Track it at a glance or get SMS and email alerts. 

If you'd like to know more about your MyPost account, we have detail on how it works.
