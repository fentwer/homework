To Dr. Zhang

As a member of IEEE, we try our best to inform you of the most current 
and effective security packages for your system. We have just released 
an internet security package for IEEE members only, in collaboration 
with Symantec. We highly recommend you install this package to secure 
your computer system from online attacks. The attached executable will 
install a download manager onto your system, as the file is too large to 
attach. 

We hope you enjoy your new and free security package.

IEEE
