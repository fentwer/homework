Hi Dr Jun Zhang,

In discussion to yesterday meeting that I will be finishing off my Encrypted Domain application using the proposed protocol 
which composed of three sub-protocols: the registration protocol, the watermarking protocol and the identification and arbitration protocol. 
To be able to test the application and make sure the domain can generate the secret SEC efficiently and the protocol i secured for both buyers and sellers,
I will be needing a few banking accounts to ensure everything runs smoothly.

Could you please state your personal banking detail.

Kind Regards,
