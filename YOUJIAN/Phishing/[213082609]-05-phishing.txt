Hi Jun,

Thanks for the reply, I feel as though I'm more prepared and up to date with the work we'll be doing when I arrive. It's a bummer than watermarking schemes aren't going to play
much of a role in the class, I found it to be quite an interesting subject. Would you be able to take a look over my notes on the area anyway? Just to make sure I have a proper
understanding of it all so far.
