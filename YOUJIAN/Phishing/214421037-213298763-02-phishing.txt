Deakin University is pleased to offer you, at no charge, two 2-day (independent) workshops at its Geelong Waurn Ponds Campus, running from April 22-25 2016.

The first workshop runs over the 2 days February 22nd and 23rd, 2016 and focuses on the manner in which wireless and mobile networks can be compromised by attacks such as, sniffing, spoofing, hijacking, man-in-the-middle, traffic injection, brute force, or denial of service as well as host-based attacks such as spyware and buffer overflows.
The second workshop runs over the 2 days April 24th and 25th, 2016 and focuses on current technologies in the commercial implementation of authentication, identity and access management. 
 
Both workshops have been designed to maximise participant engagement by providing learning activities centred around hands-on experience.
