Hello Jun,

Hope you are well. I am very happy with the Security article we published with Ivan Stojmenovic and Peter Mueller earlier this year. I was particularly interested in the piece regarding reliability in this area and want to pursue further exploration in this topic. I’ve already talked to Ivan and Peter about this and they are willing to help me. 

I’ve begun a collaboration session with the others to brainstorm potential ideas, you can reach it here (insert link). 

Are you willing to help out an old friend?

Look forward to hearing from you.

Regards, 
Yang Xiang
