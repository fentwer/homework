Dr Jun Zhang,
My name is Trudy Intruder and I have been given your details by a mutual friend Chao Chen who recommended that I get in contact with you.
I was discussing an idea for a research paper about the prevalence of encrypted network traffic and the implications on network traffic analysis and he recommended that I speak to you for some advice as you have extensive experience in this field.
We have been given a research grant of $25,000 from the Australian Signals Directorate and have only 3 months to complete the research. If you could please read the attached documentation which describes the project in more detail and get back to me that would be most appreciated.
Thank you,
Trudy Intruder.
