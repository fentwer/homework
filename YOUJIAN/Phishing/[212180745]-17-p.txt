To Dr Jun Zhang,

I've just been informed after our last meeting that Deakin staff are to log in through a different website
(still through Deakin) because of a potential security leak. They want you to log in with your old details
and then update them with new details so that you can be protected.

I know we have to change our password regularly but the faculty head confirmed that we have to reset them again.
They also mentioned that some of your articles, mainly the featured ones on certain network systems and IEEE could
be compromised, as well as other personal information without your approval.

I changed mine just before on 'website xxxxx' and thought I should let you know to do the same.

Yours sincerely,

Lei Pan
