Hey Jun,

Several students have emailed me directly regarding the marks they have received for SIT384’s first assignment. 
I have linked their assignments and question in the attachments.
They are asking for the clarification and possible score amendment on point 3 of the rubrics. 

I believe some clarification is required however I wish to run it past you before I address the issue.

Regards,
