Hi Dr Jun Zhang,

I was a student in your class and I am currently doing research about the network traffic classification specialising in clustering algorithms
based on your article: Internet Traffic Classification Using Constrained Clustering and one of your reference: A Novel Semi-Supervised Approach for Network Traffic Clustering. 

I am looking for a job in my field. I have talked to one of your co-author, Doctor Yang Xiang, and asked him if he could check my resume. 
He told me you would be a more appropriate person to ask in terms of resume checking.
Would you have a look at my resume please?
Please find my resume attachment in the email. Thank you.

Kind Regards,
Vincent On
