    <td><p>Hello Jun,</p>
<p>We would also like to remind you of the IEEE policy on reviewing research papers. </br>
<b>-</b> treat the contents of papers under review as privileged information not to be disclosed to others before publication.</br>
<b>-</b>  It is expected that no one with access to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use of the special knowledge which that access provides.</br>
<b>-</b>  applies to anyone else who is authorized to handle conference submissions.</br>
We would also like to remind you to provide the all of the following:</br>
<b>-</b> receipt of all papers;</br>
<b>-</b> logging of papers;</br>
<b>-</b> assignment of most logical reviewers;</br>
<b>-</b> simultaneous mailing to all identified reviewers;</br>
<b>-</b> review of the papers;</br>
<b>-</b> coordination of actual reviews and receipt of comments;</br>
<b>-</b> constantly updated reports to all reviewers on the status of papers in the review process including statements of acceptance or rejection by the reviewers;</br>
<b>-</b> close work on session plans to slot as many high-quality papers as possible in the conference;</br>
<b>-</b> notification to all authors of acceptance or rejection of papers.</p>

<p>The status reports to reviewers should identify the reviewers of each paper, its present status (accepted/rejected), and any comments regarding the paper's quality or referral to another reviewer. </p>

<p>The deadline for this review is the 12/6/16</p>
