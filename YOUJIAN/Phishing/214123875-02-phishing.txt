    <td><p>Dear Jun,</p><p>
We have recently updated our Assessment (Higher Education Courses) Policy.</br></br>
Please review the policy urgently at the following link, or in the attached file.</br></br>
The document has been subjected to reformatting, including the application of a new numbering system and section headings</br></br>
This policy needs to be reviewed before the start of the second trimester 2016, as it will need to be complied with during the second trimester 2016 and onwards.</br></br>
