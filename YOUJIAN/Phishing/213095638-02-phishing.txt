Greetings Jun,

Hope you are well since we last spoke.
It has been quite a while since we last work together directly, however I am hoping I could ask you for a favour.

As you now I am quite experienced in malware classification. However, I am currently in the process of writing an article for the IEEE on malware patterns and statistics and need some advice.

My issue is my lack of knowledge regarding the recognition of malware-based signatures in the machine learning process. 

It would be great if you could read over what I have done and suggest any changes or additions.

You can see what I have written to date here (insert link), you will just need to create an account to register modifications

Regards,
Silvio Cesare
