Dear Dr. Zhang,

I am emailing you in regard to accusations of failure to cite in your paper 'Robust Network Traffic Classification' I have launched a formal complaint with Deakin University and have included a copy of my lawyers request for citation letter.

As stated you have 21 days to respond to this accusation or I will accelerate the issue. 

Regards, 

John Citizen
