Dear Jun,
I was reading you paper on Network Traffic Classification using Correlation Information.
An i am struggling to understand certain parts of the paper related to the nonparammetric approach for BoF model based traffic classification, which is derived from the Bayesian decision theory.
I have attached a copy of the parts of the paper which i am struggling to understand, with annotations about what specifically i donâ€™t understand.

Your help would be much appreciated.
Regards,
