Hey Jun,
I set up an internal server to host papers and files for the department in the hopes of a better method to access key files – ITS still can’t get their share drives working properly re permissions.
It’s on our network segment for our use only.
Can you check if the following link loads your X paper properly for me?
Thanks, Wei
