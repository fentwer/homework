Hi Dr Jun Zhang,

My name is Adrian Chen, a student from Deakin University. I have been doing research about highdimensional spatial image.
I’m interested in your thesis regarding of the content-based image retrieval. 
Understanding the the problem of noisy images can not be solved, a novel CBIR was proposed for medical images is also
a very interesting point of your topic.


I'm writing to you today to arrange a phone call with you and like to ask some questions about the on the research. 
Could you please state your time and day of availability?
Could you also have a look at my research website at 'https://www.spatialimageresearch.com.au/&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=2IYEV6XCJ8G00gTbxIDQBQ' before I call you?

Kind Regards,
Adrian CHEN
