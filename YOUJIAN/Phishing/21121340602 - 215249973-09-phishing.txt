Dear Dr Zhang,

With the success of the security work you have implemented through Deakin University, we have assigned extra funding with renewed grants. We would like to extened this into the already current practice of student development with research assistance. A preliminary budget has been outlined, but we would like to seek further dicussion on how we can include more student with your IEEE papers.
