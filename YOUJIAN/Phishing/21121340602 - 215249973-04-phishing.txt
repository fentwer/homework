Hi Jun,
I’ve been in contact with Sally Brown from ACS re our adjustments to subjects. She’s sent over a future workgroup ideas in hope that we will still match if changes are implemented. I know we adjusted one recently, but could you please check your other subjects with regards to future changes.
Manny thanks
