Dr. Jun Zhang

Thankyou for getting back to me. I am pleased to see that you would be interested in contributing to this paper. We are hoping to get this paper finished
off by the end of May, a few of the articles have already been completed. I will send you over the starting point for your writing on Watermark Schemes, with
the correct layout at spacing already included in the document.
