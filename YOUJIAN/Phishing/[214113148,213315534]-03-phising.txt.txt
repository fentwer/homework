Dear Jun,
	My name is Arthur. I am a research student in university of Melbourne. Currently I am doing research on watermarking techniques. During my research work I came across some of your work on watermarking. 
	During my research I am stuck with some questions. I have attached a zip file with this email which contains all of my work and queries. If you can help me out to solve the questions I would be really thankful.
Thank you,
Arthur
