Dr Jun Zhang,
My name is Trudy Intruder and I have recently graduated from Deakin University with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in IT Security. I am writing to you to express my interest in a position within the school of IT as a tutor.
My key areas of interest are network traffic analysis and classification, machine learning and spam detection. I completed my final year project on twitter spam detection and have extensive experience and knowledge of the R programming language.
I have a commitment to ongoing education.
I have attached a copy of my Resume and Academic transcript.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Trudy Intruder.
