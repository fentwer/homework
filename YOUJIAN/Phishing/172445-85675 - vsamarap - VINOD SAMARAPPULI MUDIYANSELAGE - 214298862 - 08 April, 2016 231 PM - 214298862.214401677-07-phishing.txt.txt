Hi Jun, 
I am a junior lecturer Thomas Muller from X university and I am currently doing my master’s on System Security and I am doing my research on “Data protection Legislation and security”. I have read a few of your papers that were published online and I have a few questions that I need to discuss with you and clarify if you don’t mind. Can you please send me your private mobile number and address on this email address. 
Thank you in advance!
Thomas
