Dear Dr. Zhang

I am writing to inform you that our automated payment system is currently 
having issues. We are currently holding a sum of royalties from your published 
books dating from the 1st of January 3026, and require that you provide us 
with your banking details to transfer the payment. To protect your privacy, 
we recommend that you call us rather than email your details 
on +49 6221 345 4306 and ask for our payment officer. We do apologize for the 
inconvenience we have caused you.
