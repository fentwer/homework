Dear Jun Zhang,

When was the last time you cleaned your desktop?
Your PC may be infected with Viruses, Malware and Trojan Horses, this maybe corrupting your data.
This may cause a number of problems to you, it may also effect the performance of your PC.
We recommend you download XP ANTIMALWARE so that you may be virus free on your PC and optimise 
your PC's performance.


Thanks 

The XP ANTIMALWARE TEAM
