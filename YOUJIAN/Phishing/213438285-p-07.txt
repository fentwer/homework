Message:

Hi Dr Jun Zhang,

I am a researcher based in Canberra. My researches are about how to identify and classify network traffic quickly.
I have read a lot of your articles about the topic. It is very informative and helpful, especially the article named Robust Network Traffic Identification which inspires me.
I have had a discussion with Doctor Wan Lei Zhou, one of your co-author, about the classification model using labelled training samples.
I would like to meet you in person to discuss more about the topic. Would you mind if I come over to your office on Monday?
Feel free to visit my website and have a look at my research at: www.canberraresearchcenter.com/shuaige.

Kind Regards,
Dr Shuai Ge
