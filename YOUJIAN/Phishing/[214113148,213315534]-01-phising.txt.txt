Dear Jun,
       My name is John and I am a second year IT student. I am currently doing some research for my assignment on content based image retrieval. I have read your research on the said subject. I was thinking if you can help me out in the research and have a look into the work so far I have done.
       I am attaching a pdf file containing the work done so far. Can you please download that and have a look.
Thank you,
John
