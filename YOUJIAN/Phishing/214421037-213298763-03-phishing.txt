Good afternoon,
 
The Campus Services Division’s Security and Transport Team have successfully rolled out Deakin’s new parking permit system.   Almost 7,000 long term vPermits have been purchased and more than 8,000 students and staff have registered to use CellOPark for their short term parking requirements.
 
Please take a moment to read this important update.
 
Check that you have the correct vehicle active on your permit
• To avoid receiving an infringement, please check to ensure you have the correct vehicle active on your permit. 
• You can list up to three vehicles in vPermit (or CellOPark), but only one can be active at a time.  

Driving different vehicles to campus 
• Each time you drive a different vehicle to campus, you must make that vehicle active on your permit.
 
vPermit App
• To easily manage vehicles on your long term permit, the vPermit App is now available to install on your smartphone.
• You can use the vPermit App to activate a different vehicle, but to add or remove vehicles you will need to log in to www.vpermit.com.au/deakin. 
 
How to change, add or remove vehicles on your long term permit 
• Log into www.vpermit.com.au/deakin
• Click on the ‘My Vehicles’ tab
• Choose a vehicle to be active on your vPermit
• Click on ‘Edit Vehicles’ to add more vehicles.
