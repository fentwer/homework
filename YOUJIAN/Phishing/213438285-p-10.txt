Hi Dr Jun Zhang,
I am interest in the low-level feature representation for medical image experiment and how the 
six texture features corresponding to human visual perception: coarseness, contrast, directionality, 
line-likeness, regularity, androughness play an important role in the experiment.
I have done the experiment but it does not give me the desire result.
We have recorded a video about the experient.
Would you mind spending some time to have a look at it at youtube.com.au/medicalimage?


Kind Regards,
Doctor Michael Jackson
