Subject: PHD looking for more Insight

Message: 

Dear Dr Zhang,

My name is Paolo Ruiz, and I'm a PHD student here at Deakin University,
doing my research on Data Clustering, and was wandering if you could give me a little bit of insight,
I've linked my research down below so I was wandering if you could please take a look,
and give me some advice.

Thanks Paolo
