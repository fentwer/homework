Hi Jun,

Thanks for the help, I think we're all set for our technical demosntration now. And thanks for explaining watermarking schemes for me,
I've done a little bit more research on it and made some notes, I think I understand it better now. Could you take a quick look over
them and just make sure I've got a grasp on it?
