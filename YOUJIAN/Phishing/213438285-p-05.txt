Hi Dr Jun Zhang,

Recently I have finished a new research on Watermarking Protocols. The waterkmarking algorithms are a bit too complicated and I am not 100% sure
that it's correct.And can you also please have a look at the security analysis section because I am also uncertain about the UTTP part.
I would like to know if it was correct and informative to the reader.
Could you please download the article in the attachment. 
Any feedbacks given would be appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Dr Wanlei Zhou
