Your 2015 Medibank Tax Statement

Dear Mr Zhang

Thanks for being a Medibank member. At Medibank, we want everyone to enjoy the value and peace of mind that private health insurance provides, as well as the benefit of the Australian Government Rebate on private health insurance, if you're eligible.

Here is your Private Health Insurance Statement 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 (tax statement), which you'll need to complete your 2015 tax return.

For your information, we attach a Standard Information Statement*, which sets out the key features of your cover and standard waiting periods (it doesn't reflect waiting periods you've already served), and a Lifetime Health Cover statement, if applicable.

We're here to help

Let's make this tax time better. For help with understanding the tax statement, please read the handy 'how to read' guide attached or visit Tax time 2015 for tax time tips.

To access your tax statement any time after 15 July, login to online member services http://onlineservices-medibank.cn- or register here: http://register-medibank.cn

All the best,

Jason Gowie
Divisional General Manager, Sales & Service
