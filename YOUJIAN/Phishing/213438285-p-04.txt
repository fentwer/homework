Subject: Twitter spam detection model
Message:

Hi Dr Jun Zhang,

I am a PhD student and have read lots of articles on Twitter spam.
After asking for some tips from Doctor Wanlei Zhou, I have created a Twitter spam detection model based on your article about 6 million spam Tweets.
I am having a bit of trouble with the performace of the classifiers of the models and the model's accuracy.
Could you please watch the video by clicking on the URL: http://www.youtube.com/%fw/Spam./ljhnju
Any feedbacks given would be appreciated.

Kind Regards,
