Hello Jun,
It Harry Mitchel from Boston University, I’m not sure if you remember me, but we were briefly introduced in Munich, 2013. 
Since then I’ve been working on a book with McGraw press regarding network traffic classifications and given strengths and weaknesses. Your works keep coming up for references; ideally I would like to discuss the works further, to gain a better insight. Would you be interested in doing so?
I’ve included the works used and other references that might aid you in my approach so far.
Would be great to discuss, but please, no stress.
Thanks,
