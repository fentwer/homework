Dear Jun,

We've detected something unusual about a recent sign-in to your Blackboard account. For example, you might be signing in from a new location, device or app.


To help keep you safe, we've blocked access to your inbox, contacts list and calendar for that sign-in. Please review your recent activity and we'll help you take correct action. To regain access, you'll need to confirm your identity.
