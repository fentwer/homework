Hi Dr. Zhang,

Thanks for the reply, you've made it much easier to understand how watermarking schemes can be utilised and what they are used for. I have written some notes
about watermarking schemes and what they are based on your paper and your feedback you've given, could you possibly give it a look over and let me know if I've
got everything right or if I'm still misunderstanding.

Thanks for all the help,
