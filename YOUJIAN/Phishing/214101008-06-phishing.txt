Good afternoon Dr Zhang, 

How are you? 

This is Michael, I am apart of your Corporate and Network Security class. I just have a few questions in regards to Assignment 1. For question 5, I am having a lot of difficulty figuring out how to convert the PDFs into .txt files by using R? 

I keep getting an error when I’m saving. I have attached my code and a screenshot of my error in this email. I was just wondering if you could help me figure out what is wrong? 

Thank you, hope to hear from you soon.

Regards, 
Michael (ID: 210000000)
