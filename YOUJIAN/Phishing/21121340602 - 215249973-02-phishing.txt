Hello Jun,
It’s Jerry form Wyoming University. I have been in discussion with Yang Xiang in potentially furthering your research on Effective Network Classification. Yang aims to approach you formally, but I thought to make contact early. Due to increase interest from large enterprise stakeholders in improving security intrusion detection, a security working committee has been formed and an initial charter proposed. If you’re interested, please review and make contract with me, or until you hear from Yang.

Regards,

Jerry
