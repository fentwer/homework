To Dr. Jun,

Me and my collegues from the University of London are coming down for a conference in Melbourne in the middle of the year.
We've looked through various of your reports from 2008-2016 with co-authors such as Yong Xiang, Bin Zhao, Gang Li and
Sheng Wen. We would like to formally invite you to make a presentation for the event.

The conference is invitation only to do with frameworks, image retrieval, filtering, flow detection and more. We can see
that you are specialized in these fields and feel this could be a good business opportunity. There is potential for you
to do another conference in London at the end of the year.

All we ask is for you to register on our site [here]. Please inform any other co-authors if you think they would be
good for presentations as well since we require another 3. 

Thank you for your time.

Regards,

Romeo Vander
