Dear Jun,

I am currently creating an aggregation protocol which utilises a paper which you co-authored related to traffic classification using correlation information.
I am currently struggling to implement the MVT-NN aggregation strategy.
I have attached a copy of what i have currently created, and if you are available would appreciate if you could review it and provide any feedback which you think may be useful.
Your discretion is greatly appreciated.

Best regard,
Kyle Henderson.
