Hi Dr Zhang,

In regarding to your research on data sparsity, I have also investigated information on how data sparsity brings 
significant challenges to the recommended system.
I am doing research into a novel imputation method (AutAI) to identify a key set of missing data for each 
rating prediction to address the problem of data sparsity.
I was wondering whether you can give me some feedbacks on my researched report. 
I have attached the file in the attachment for you to look at.

Any additional information provided will be beneficial towards my research.

I look forward to hear from you.

Kind Regards,
