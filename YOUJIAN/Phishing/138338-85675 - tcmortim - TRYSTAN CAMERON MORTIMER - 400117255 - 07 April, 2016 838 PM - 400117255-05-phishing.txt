To Dr Jun Zhang,
We have recently received several allegations of you conducting yourself in an inappropriate manner in your lectures. Deakin University takes every complaint seriously and will investigate these incidents. I have attached a copy of the Universities staff policy document. Please familiarise yourself with this document and ensure you uphold and display these standards in the future.
Given your exceptional history with the University I hope that the above allegations are not true, you will be given every opportunity to explain and clarify the situation.
I would like to make an appointment with you to discuss the matter further. Please call me on 1234-5678 at your earliest convenience.
Thank you,
Jane den Hollander
Vice chancellor
