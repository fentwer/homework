Thankyou for replying, it is good to see that you are interested in the position and the University of Melbourne. The application forms have been sent out to you, and should arrive
in the post in a few days. As for now, we have finalised our decision to include an assignment on Watermarking schemes in the Corporate IT security course. We have prepared a draft of
what this assignment would entail, and would appreciate if you could give it a look over, and make any improvements that you feel would benefit the students of the course in helping
them better understand Watermarking Schemes.
