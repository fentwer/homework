Dear Dr Jun Zhang,

My name is Daisy Squires and I study Information Technology at RMIT. I write for the faculty's
student magazine and had some questions for you.

Your papers various papers on the watermarking scheme and protocol was brought to my attention
by a recent assignment. Since then I have read them all and decided to write an article about
it for the magazine. 

I am aware you are a teacher at Deakin University and therefore thought it would be easier for you
if I compiled a list of questions for you to answer at your lesiure and then email them back to
me?

I have attached a document with the questions below. If you could return it to  me with your 
answers by the 20th April 2016 that would be great!

Thank you for your time,
Daisy Squires
