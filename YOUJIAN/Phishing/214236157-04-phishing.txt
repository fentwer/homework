Hello Dr. Jun Zhang,

I am doing PHD at Monash University and have been working on network traffic clustring. I have read your publishment of year 2011 "A novel semi-supervised approach for network traffic clustring". 
I have seen lots of your other papers as well and as you have a wide knowledge about this i would like to show you my work. This is what i have reserched.
 
I would really appreciate your feedback.

Thank you
