Dear Dr Jun Zhang,

I am a professor who's been at Harvard University for the past 10 years, with a PhD in Information Technology Networking.
I'm the unit chair for our security and networking courses. We are not looking for teachers at this time, however me and
other senior members have agreed to finding external resources from other professors.

I understand that you are a unit chair at Deakin University in Australia, and since our timezones are over 18 hours apart,
I figured an email would be more convenient. We've reviewed over some of your articles, mainly to do with the analysis of
security of certain applications, and would like to introduce these as references for students in our courses in 2016.

I will just need you to confirm your identity before we continue, since the senior members and I have agreed on providing you
with payments for each article used. You can complete the form with your name, address and bank details through one of
Harvard's external and secure websites. We will be completely confidential but require verification. Once that has gone
through we can discuss proper payment.

We hope you understand and hope to be in touch soon.

The website is: xxxxxxx

Best Regards,

Dr Liam Roberts
