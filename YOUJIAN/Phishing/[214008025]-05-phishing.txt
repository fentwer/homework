Dear Dr Zhang,
My name is Steve Stark and I am currently a research student at University of New South Wales.
I read your 2009/10 published paper on content based image retrieval and I was hoping to have a few moments of your time to have some input on my current thesis.
Attached is my introduction and a chapter on content based image retrieval and I was hoping that you may have some time to have a look through that.
After reading your paper I had a few questions on what you have written in regards to W.M Smeluders’ paper on ‘content-based image retrieval at the end of the 
early years.’ 

If you would like to contact me so we can discuss this, my contact number is 0412 345 567 or my email address is steve.t.stark@gmail.com

I look forward to hearing your reply.
Regards,
Steve Stark
UNSW Research Student
