Hi Dr Jun Zhang,
I currently studying the SIT384 unit and doing assignment 1. 
I am having a trouble understanding why noisy images can severely affect the retrieval performance from your article: Medical Image Retrieval Based on Image Bags.
I have also read your references but they don't really help. 
I contaced Doctor Yang Xiang and he refers me to you.
Would you mind if I come to your office on Monday and ask you a few questions?
Can you also have a look at my report that I am doing?
Please find my report attacted below.


Kind Regards,
Vincent On
