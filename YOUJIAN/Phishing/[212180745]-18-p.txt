Dear Dr Jun,

I'm one of your students working on an assignment, and I'm having difficulty with extracting some information
from some of your articles. I'm getting confused by your 'Watermarking protocol of secure verification' and 'Properties
of Series Feature Aggregation Schemes' that I wanted to use. 

I wanted to test them using R, but I think I'm having a problem with my code. I can't send you my assignment, so I just want
you to see if you can get me in the right track with the algorithm because I can get a list but I can't make it appear.

I've attached my code below.

Thanks for your help,

John
