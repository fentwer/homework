As part of the universities commitment to providing better equipped information services to the school of information technology, faculty of science engineering & built environment, the university has partnered up with the developers of vmware to create a online vmware platform called the 'Deakin University School of IT Student Cloud' (Duclouds).
As this system was proposed by several security and network lecturers from the faculty of IT to be implemented into the current practical course work, to replace the current outdated system.
