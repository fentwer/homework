Dr. Jun Zhang

Thankyou so much for getting back to me and agreeing to do this guest lecture! It's going to do wonders for me and my students.
Alright, well the timing is pretty much whenever suits you best. The class is on every Tuesday and Wednesday from 2pm-4pm. Any time
you can fit it in would be wonderful. And just because it's what I'm supposed to do, I'll need you to have a quick look over your paper
here and just confirm that it's yours.

Sorry, just the administration stuff. Thanks a lot, I hope to see you soon!

Dr. Janet Taylor
