Dear Jun Zhang,

I have been working on a new paper regarding Zero-day node cluster prevention, as we have both worked on something similar to this previously. I would like you to look over my findings and report to become a co-author.

Please find the PDF attached to this email to view my work so far.

Kind regards, L Ye.
