Dear Dr Zhang,

I am an honours student studying at Deakin University. I have read some of your published papers and found them really fascinating. I'm interested in conducting some research on network traffic and I'm currently looking for a supervisor to guide me in my research. I have attached my resume and cover letter. I would greatly appreciate it if you could take my application into consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards,
Emily de Silva.
