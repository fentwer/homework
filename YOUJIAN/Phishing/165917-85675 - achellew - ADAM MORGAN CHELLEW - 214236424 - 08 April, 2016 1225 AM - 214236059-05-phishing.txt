Dear Dr. Zhang

Deakin has been asked to review its antimalware and spyware firewalls. With these reviews we would like you and other IT security heads to go through and test the accuracy of our firewalls here at Deakin. Enclosed in this email you will find a PDF document with the tests we would like conducted, advised by the Victorian government of education.

Sincerely, Vice-Chancellor Jane den Hollander
