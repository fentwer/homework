Good Afternoon Dr Zhang,
Please find attached the assignment extension request form for Unit SIT384, Assignment One.
As the unit chair for this assignment, please review this form and take into consideration my extreme circumstances.
The reasons behind this request is that I was admitted into the Emergency ward at Maroondah Hospital yesterday with a ruptured appendix. The assignment that is due on the 5th of April 2016 will not be able to be completed until after my recovery from surgery. I am happy to send through, when I am able, a copy of this assignment that has been completed to date.

Regards,
Gabrielle Harradine
