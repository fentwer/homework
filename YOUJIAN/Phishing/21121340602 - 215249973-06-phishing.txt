Hi Dr Zhang,
As you are value contributor to IEEE publication, we would like you join us at ICC 2016 - 2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications 23 May - 27 May 201.
The International Conference on Communications (ICC) is one of the two flagship conferences of the IEEE Communications Society, together with IEEE GLOBECOM. Each year the ICC conference attracts about 2-3000 submitted scientific papers, a technical program committee involving about 1500 experts provides more than 10000 reviews, the conference being finally attended by 1500 - 2000 professionals from all around the world. IEEE ICC is therefore one of the most significant scientific events of the networking and communications community, a must-attend forum for both industrials and academics working in this area.
