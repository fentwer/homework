Dear Dr Jun Zhang,
I work for the Microsoft development team in Sydney and I will be visiting Melbourne soon and would the opportunity to speak to some undergraduate students about the opportunities for working at Microsoft.
We have an excellent graduate program which sees graduates get experience working with many different teams eventually settling with one that fits them the best. 
I have attached my travel dates if you could please find the time for me to speak to the students during these dates that would be fantastic.
Many thanks,
Carl.
Head of Microsoft dev team Sydney.
