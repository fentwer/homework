Dear Dr Jun Zhang

I am a representative from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore Digital Library (IEEE) and I regret to inform you that several of your Publications such as 'Asymmetric self-learning for tackling Twitter Spam Drift', have encountered several problems due to a now resolved computer system error.
As a result, a loss of data occurred, which affected several publications which you are listed as primary or secondary author user.
Due to a security update to the terms and conditions of our website, it is important navigate to the following website, confirm the amended terms and conditions and the republish any information pertaining to the affected publications.
Failure to do so will result in these publications being temporily hidden from the IEEE Xplore Digital Library website and a publication limit which will restrict the number of future submitted publications.

Regards

George Green
IEEE Academic Publication Board

Thank you for your time
