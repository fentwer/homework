Dr Jun Zhang,
My name is Professor Intruder from Monash University. Next month I will be giving a presentation on the security of social network applications and the implications for mobile device users. The talk is next friday 3PM the 15th April.
We have gathered some fantastic data for this presentation and hope you will be able to make it.
Please see the attached map for parking and building location.
We hope to see you there,
Professor Intruder.
