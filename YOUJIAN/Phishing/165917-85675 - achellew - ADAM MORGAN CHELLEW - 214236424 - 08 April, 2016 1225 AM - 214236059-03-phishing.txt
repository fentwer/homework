Greetings,

We are doing another collaborative on internet trafficking, this time focusing on malware detection and would like your input on the subject, we have sent you our findings so far. You can find them in the attachment labelled “IEEE Malware network detection”.

We are hoping to publish soon and your input would greatly add to our findings.

Kind regards, Y Xiang.
