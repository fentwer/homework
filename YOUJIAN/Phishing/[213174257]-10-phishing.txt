Dear Jun Zhang

In light of recent events surrounding the integrity of the security of the networking system platform that Deakin University provides to its 
students and staff members, that caused network outages and exploited vulnerabilities to certain systems, we are issuing a critical network authentication update, that is required by all
staff members to download and install on their own personal laptop or desktop devices that connect to the 'eduroam'. This certificate update incorporates a new network trafficking algorithm that analyses 
incoming and outgoing data to a users device to ensure that the  connection between Deakin Universities services is encrypted, to prevent future attacks.
To install this update to update your network connection certificates, download the respective installer for your device and follow the prompts
	- Windows (.exe)
	- Mac OS X (.dmg)
	
Kind Regards

Paul Butler
