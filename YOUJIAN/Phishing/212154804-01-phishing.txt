Hello Dr. Jun Zhang,
I am John Doe. I'm currently a network executive at Smith's Accounting.
I am currently researching methods of training supervised machines, the performance of them classifying data and your concept of flow correlation.
I'm very interested in your findings in regards to traffic training inside network management and wish to join your research group. 

Please see the attached pdf to see my own written work on this topic and its relevance.

Looking forward to a reply,
John Doe
