Dear Dr Jun Zhang,

My name is Robert Richards and I am currently completing my Masters in Information 
Technology. 

I have become fascinated with the possibilities of Content based image retrieval and 
recently completed a paper on it. 

Throughout the process of writing my paper I was constantly reading all your papers in
relation to the topic and used a majority of it as a basis for my study. Given you 
have such a vast knowledge in the area it would mean a lot if you could read my paper
and give me your thoughts and opinions on it?

I understand you are a busy man, but if you have a chance I have attached the paper below 
for your conveinience.

Kind Regards,
Robert Richards
