Dear Dr Jun Zhang,
My name is Trudy Intruder and I am charge of the upgrading of your building, we will soon be commencing refurbishment of your office along with several other rooms and we would like to give you the opportunity to pick the new colour of carpet that will be installed.
I have attached a colour chart with the available options for you to look at, it is not a wide selection but it will give you the opportunity to have some input.
We look forward to your feedback,
Sincerely,
Trudy Intruder
Head of redevelopment.
