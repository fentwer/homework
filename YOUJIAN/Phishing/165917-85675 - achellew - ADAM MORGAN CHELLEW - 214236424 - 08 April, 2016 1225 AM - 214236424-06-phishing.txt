Hello Jun, it has been a while since our last talk so you are probably wondering what it is that i am contacting you about. This email is regarding a proposal for an updated traffic classifcation paper with a focus on a new cluster analysis technique. I believe our previous works need to continued as my recent research on the topic has brought up very interesting results. I have started working on the paper myself with much to show as of the writing of this email. I would appreciate if you would take the time to read over my work so far and hopefully collaborate with me in completing this paper. I have attached my work on the subject below. I look forward to our continued collaboration in future.
Regards, Yu Whang.
