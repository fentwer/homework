Dear Dr Jun Zhang,

My name is Paul Kirk and I am a part of a group of start up investors. We recently had 
your Robust Statistical Traffic Classification scheme bought to our attention through 
our networks at Deakin University. We were very impressed with what you and your 
collegues propose. 

As such we would like to provide you and your collegues with seed capital. This will
enable you to get your idea off the ground and up and running. 

If this is something that is of interest to you and your collegues please click on the
link below. This will redirect you to our website where you will be able to see what
we are all about and our current investments. 

Furthermore, there will be a document for you to fill in with regards to how much funding
you believe will be necessary and other details that will help us help you!

I look forward to discussing this with you further,
Kind Regards,
Paul Kirk
