Dear Jun Zhang, we over at the services department of twitter are begginning a new project as part of our new goal of cracking down on spam across our website. This specificcally covers spam classification, an area we know you have a good understanding of. We request that you join us and contribute as we see you as a valuable asset to the project. Your coauther Wanlei Zhou has also been contacted regarding the matter.
An application form can be found attached, which includes instructions on how to continue.
Looking forward to working with you Jun,  - Brendan Claffey.
