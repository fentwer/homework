Dear Dr Jun Zhang,

My name is Helena Matron and I am a prominent figure in the investment field. I have been 
informed that you may have recently been approached by a small group of investors with
regards to your Robust Statistical Traffic Classification scheme. 

We at Bailador recognise the potential of your scheme and would like the opportunity to 
help you and your team progress it further. We believe it is important to recognise the 
ideas of the experts in their chosen field and  help them to get their ideas off the 
ground. 

As stated we are aware the some competitors may have already approached you but we would
appreciate the opportuity to further discuss with you and your collegues what it is
we believe we can help you achieve. 

We understand that you need to do what is best for you and your team but also feel it is
important to be aware of all your options. 

If you would like to further this discussion please do not hesitate to contact me so we
can arrange a suitable time.
