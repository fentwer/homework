Dear Dr Jun Zhang

My name is Amanda, I have a picture of you up on my wall, I am your biggestttttt fan. I have been reading a lot of your work. I am currently doing a paper myself on keeping network systems secure and also about network protocols at university. I am really interested to learn about encryption too. I have been working on a basic word processing program too. I've attached it if u could please check it out and give me feedback. 

Thanks a lot :D
