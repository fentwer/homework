Dear students,
We are experiencing some problems with our server and therefore we are going to implement a new registration system. All the students are required to complete their registration before the starting of their semester. It enables to get their classes on time. Please register for your courses. Otherwise, the student will not receive their grades for courses. Once the classes start, they cannot add courses for their current semester. The payment details are also required to fill up. The university should also have the right to cancel the registration if the student fails to pay the tuition fees. Please register for your account including the banking details.
Thank You.
