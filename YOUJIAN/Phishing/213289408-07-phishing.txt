VIOLATION OF VISA

Dr. Jun Zhang,

It is the belief of the Australian Government that the research you are conducting in regards to unauthorised watermarking violates your visa. 

It is advised that you contact the Australian Visa Hotline on <a>9735 7724</a> to obtain more information. Seller watermarking and encryption are amongst the highest offences in Australia and are treated seriously. 

In order to prevent arrest and/or deportation please call <a>9735 7724</a>

For more information you can find the laws around beaching visas <a>here</a>

Yours truly,

Dallas Green
